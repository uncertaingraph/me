## Research skills
<div style="text-align: justify">
My strongest suit is probabilistic thinking and a risk-informed approach to problem solving. I owe my understanding of probability to my academic advisor, <a href="http://dmnicol.web.engr.illinois.edu/">Prof. David M. Nicol</a>, who encouraged me to study Bayesian analysis earlier on in my research journey. My other source of inspiration came from a wonderful book written by E. T. Jaynes, <a href="https://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf">"Probability: the logic of science"</a>. Since then, probability became the foundation that allowed me to explore other research topics such as random process, Monte Carlo methods, risk modeling and analysis, and other topics listed below. 
</div><br>

* <b>Bayesian analysis:</b> Bayesian belief network and Bayesian inference.<br>
* <b>Monte Carlo methods:</b> topics in rare event simulation (e.g., adaptive sampling based on cross-entropy method, population Monte Carlo) and variance reduction (importance sampling, stratified sampling).<br>
* <b>Risk analysis:</b> Uncertainty modeling and quantification, probabilistic risk analysis.<br>
* <b>System reliability:</b> Fault tree, event tree, network reliability, binary decision diagram.<br>
* <b>Applied probability and statistics:</b> Markov chain, Markov decision process, stochastic Petri nets, hidden Markov model, queueing theory, hypothesis testing, dependence modeling with copulas.<br>
* <b>Graph theory</b>, including graphs with random elements such as uncertain graphs.<br>
* <b>Optimization:</b> Global and heuristic optimization.<br>
* <b>Machine learning:</b> Neural networks, multi-armed bandit, regression analysis, reinforcement learning.<br>

### Other research projects I have completed or participated in at UIUC:

* <b>ECE598 Dependable AI systems:</b> Developed rare-event simulation technique for safety evaluation of automated driving technology with machine-learning components. Evaluated the simulation  technique using scenarios developed from Matlab's Automated Driving Toolbox.<br>
          
* <b>CS598 Reliability of cloud-scale systems:</b> Proposed programmable network-based resiliency testing tool for data center networks.<br>
          
* <b>Social simulation:</b> Participated in UIUC's team to compete in <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/news/cs-ece-professors-explore-how-social-media-spreads-information-affects-beliefs-and-even-shapes">DARPA's SocialSim Challenge</a>. Developed agent-based simulation framework for modeling information propagation over social networks. Proposed model selection algorithm for composite model with discrete state transitions.

## Software development skills

### Melody
<div style="text-align: justify">
Our group at UIUC developed <a href="https://github.com/Vignesh2208/Melody">Melody</a>, a cyber-physical systems co-simulation tool for generating nework traffic containing traces of cyber-attacks. The network packet capture (PCAP) generated by Melody can be used to train machine learning-based network intrusion detection systems. The documentation of Melody can be found <a href="https://melody-by-projectmoses.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html">[here]</a>. A demonstration of how Melody can be used to simulation a cyber-attack on the <a href="https://electricgrids.engr.tamu.edu/electric-grid-test-cases/ieee-39-bus-system/">39-bus power system</a> is given in the video below.

### Living lab
<div style="text-align: justify">
At ADSC, I was an active member of the living lab project. I helped designing, developing, and deploying a wireless sensor network in the office space to study building energy efficiency. The living lab consists of 100+ Zigbee radio-powered sensors, including power plug sensors (provided by Korea Electronics Technology Institute), ambient light, temperature, and humidity sensors, PIR motion sensors, and CO2 sensors. I also developed a monitoring and management system for data collection, storage, and troubleshooting.

### Other projects I did at ADSC

* Developed a commercial-off-the-shelf and high sample rate current sensing platform based on the <a href="http://wiki.zolertia.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Zolertia Z1 mote</a> and TinyOS operating system.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uncertaingraph/me/master/images/2013-01-07%2019.15.34.jpg"> <br>

* Developed a Python-based driver for the <a href="https://www.powermeterstore.com/product/veris-e31-panelboard-monitoring-system">Veris E31</a> panelboard monitoring system.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uncertaingraph/me/master/images/2013-06-12%2015.12.58.jpg"> <br>

* Built a 30-node Raspberry Pi cluster to run software-defined networking (SDN) applications.
