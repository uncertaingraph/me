## About me
<div style="text-align: justify">
Welcome to my home on the web! My name is Frank, I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My academic advisor is <a href="http://dmnicol.web.engr.illinois.edu/">Prof. David M. Nicol</a>.
</div><br>
<div style="text-align: justify">
My research at UIUC lies at the intersection between network security, graph theory, probability theory, and quantitative risk. My first goal is to develop a theoretical framework for expressing uncertainty in modeling of multi-step cyber-attacks. My next goal is to design efficient algorithms based on Monte Carlo methods for quantifying the impacts of cyber-attacks against networked computer systems. The estimated impact will help network defenders make quantitative and risk-informed defense decisions prior to and during a cyber-attack.

Prior to Illinois, I worked for four years (2011-2015) as a full-time software engineer at the <a href="https://adsc.illinois.edu/">Advanced Digital Sciences Center</a> (ADSC), a Singapore-based research center established and led by UIUC and funded by Singapore's Agency for Science, Technology, and Research (A*STAR). I worked with <a href="https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/david-yau">Prof. David Yau</a>, <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/tanrui/">Prof. Rui Tan</a>, <a href="https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/binbin-chen">Prof. Binbin Chen</a>, and Dr. Daekwoo Jung on smart grid security, demand response, building energy efficency, and wireless sensor networks.

I got my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from the School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2011. In my undergrad thesis, I designed a control scheme to save mobile device's battery power by adapting the LCD screen brightness level to the ambient light and the running applications.
