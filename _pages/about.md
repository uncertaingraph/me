<div style="text-align: justify">
Welcome to my home on the web! My name is Frank, I am currently a Software Engineer (SDE-II) at Amazon AWS.
</div><br>

<div style="text-align: justify">
Before joining Amazon, I was an ECE Ph.D. student from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) under <a href="http://dmnicol.web.engr.illinois.edu/">Prof. David M. Nicol</a>. My research combined network security, graph theory, probability theory, and quantitative risk to answer a fundamental question "how to accurately and efficiently estimate the risk of cyber-attacks against networks?" The answer to the question helps network defenders make timely, optimal, and risk-informed defense decisions proactively and reactively--i.e., prior to and during a network breach.

<div style="text-align: justify">
Prior to Illinois, I worked for four years as a full-time Software Engineer at the <a href="https://adsc.illinois.edu/">Advanced Digital Sciences Center</a> (ADSC), a Singapore-based research center established and led by UIUC and funded by Singapore's Agency for Science, Technology, and Research (A*STAR). I worked with <a href="https://csl.illinois.edu/directory/faculty/rkiyer">Prof. Ravishankar Iyer</a>, <a href="https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/kalbarcz">Prof. Zbigniew Kalbarczyk</a>, <a href="https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/david-yau">Prof. David Yau</a>, <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/tanrui/">Prof. Rui Tan</a>, <a href="https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/binbin-chen">Prof. Binbin Chen</a>, and Dr. Daekwoo Jung on smart grid security, demand response, building energy efficency, and wireless sensor networks.

I got my bachelor degree in Computer Engineering from the School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS) in 2011. In my undergrad thesis, I designed a control scheme to save mobile device's battery power by adapting the LCD screen brightness level to the ambient light and the running applications.

## Announcement
<div style="text-align: justify">
  <b>September 06th, 2022:</b> Happy to share that I have joined Amazon AWS as a Software Engineer (SDE-II). 
</div><br>
  
<b>May 24th, 2022:</b> I passed the doctoral final examination! The title of my thesis is <i>"Modeling and analysis of trustworthy systems using extensions of network reliability"</i>.
</div><br>

<div style="text-align: justify">
<b>March 14th, 2022:</b> Our paper <i>"Exploiting monotonicity and symmetry for evaluation of highly dependable systems"</i> has been accepted to the 52nd Annual IEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks (DSN 2022).

<DIV ID="DSN_Abstract" STYLE="display:none; padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; background-color:Gainsboro;"><i>"Evaluation of highly dependable systems requires estimating the probability of a significant rare event under which the system fails to meet the requirement. To improve the estimation accuracy, advanced Monte Carlo simulation techniques such as importance sampling (IS) are commonly used. However, IS is known to misbehave under high dimension. As a result, the IS estimator can have a large relative error and underestimate the rare event probability. In this paper, we propose a novel IS method based on the idea of maximum weight minimization (MWM). Our method works by finding the sampling distribution that minimizes the maximum weight of a rare event sample. To alleviate the curse of dimensionality, we develop several heuristics based on two problem-specific structures, namely, monotonicity and symmetry. Using extensive examples from network reliability, stochastic flow analysis, cyber-security risk assessment, and fault tree analysis, we evaluate the performance of MWM, demonstrate its accuracy and scalability, and highlight applications where it outperforms state-of-the-art techniques."</i></DIV>

<b>February 23rd, 2022:</b> Our paper <i>"A model-based approach for quantitative decision-making in cybersecurity incident response"</i>, has been accepted to the 9th Annual Hot Topics in Science of Security, Special Session on Works-in-Progress (HotSoS 2022).
<BUTTON ONCLICK="ShowAndHide('HOTSOS_Abstract')">Abstract</BUTTON>
<DIV ID="HOTSOS_Abstract" STYLE="display:none; padding-left: 7px; padding-right: 7px; background-color:Gainsboro;"><i>"Cybersecurity incident response (CSIR) is an integral part of the organization's risk management strategy to reduce the damage to the network after the initial breach. In spite of the great financial interest and the recent developments, CSIR remains a rather complex process. In particular, the existing literature lacks a quantitative approach that can effectively deal with the complex, uncertain, and rapidly changing nature of cyberattacks. In this work, we developed a model-based approach that seeks to address part of this challenge. The approach allows the defender to (i) aggregate noisy, incomplete, and sometimes conflicting information about the attack and, without fully knowing the scope of the attack, (ii) come up with a containment plan that minimizes the impact of the attack on the network and the cost of making wrong containment decisions based on inaccurate information. We illustrated the approach using an example of a small network and discussed ideas for the future work."</i></DIV>

<b>February 20th, 2022:</b> Happy to share that I will be working at <a href="https://imanage.com/">iManage</a> as a Data Science Intern this summer. My role is to work on various algorithms and use Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to "rigorously measure the product quality, improve enterprise products, and understand the behavior of end-users".
